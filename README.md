This repository contains all the homework projects for the CS204: Advanced Programming course. The assignments cover various advanced C++ programming concepts, providing hands-on experience with data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. Here's a breakdown of each homework assignment:

Homework 1: Matrix Operations
The project involves finding and counting specific strings within a 2D matrix. The program reads an input matrix from a file and searches for strings of a given length, moving in four directions (left, right, up, down) without revisiting cells. It demonstrates matrix handling and file input/output operations​(CS204-2019-HW01).

Homework 2: Customer Cart Management
This assignment builds a simple e-commerce system using linked lists. It manages customer data and their shopping carts dynamically, allowing operations like adding/removing customers and products. The focus is on singly and doubly linked lists, pointers, and memory management techniques such as dynamic allocation and deallocation​(CS204-2019-HW02).

Homework 3: Two Languages Conversion
The project simulates the translation of a simple programming language, CS++, into machine code. It uses stacks, queues, and linked lists to perform operations like variable storage, arithmetic, and memory management. The task emphasizes data structure usage in translating and executing code step-by-step​(CS204-2019-HW03).

Homework 4: Object-Oriented Programming
This task focuses on implementing object-oriented features like constructors, destructors, and operator overloading in a SortedArray class. The project also demonstrates the creation of deep copy constructors and overloaded operators for addition and assignment, showcasing how to manage sorted arrays in C++​(CS204-2019-HW04).

Homework 5: Trie Implementation and Iterators
This assignment involves building a Trie data structure, a tree-like structure used for efficient word storage and searching. It also requires implementing iterators for the Trie, along with operator overloading for various operations like insertion, traversal, and merging. The focus is on building complex data structures and custom iterators​(CS204-2019-HW05).

Homework 6: Templates and Bit Operations
The project involves developing a template class to perform simple cryptographic operations like XOR, circular shifting, and bit flipping. It showcases template programming, bit manipulation, and encryption/decryption algorithms in C++​(CS204-2019-HW06).

Homework 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism
This assignment implements a class hierarchy with inheritance, focusing on polymorphism and dynamic binding. The project builds a base class, Human, with derived classes like Muggle, Wizardkind, Student, and GrownUp. It demonstrates polymorphic behavior through virtual functions and dynamic object management​(CS204-2019-HW07).

Homework 8: Multithreading Simulation
The final project simulates a relay race using multithreading. It requires creating threads for each runner, managing thread synchronization, and updating race progress. The simulation emphasizes concurrent programming, thread management, and synchronization techniques in C++​(CS204-2019-HW08).
